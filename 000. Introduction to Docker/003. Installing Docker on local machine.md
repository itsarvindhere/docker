Alright then, it's time to get started with "Docker".

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. It simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying applications by providing a consistent environment across different systems and stages of the development lifecycle.

Let's see the simplest way to install docker which is using "Docker Desktop". 

Docker Desktop is a software application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and tools to work with Docker on a local machine, typically on Windows and macOS. It allows developers to easily manage Docker containers, images, and other Docker resources on their personal computer, without needing to set up a complex environment manually.
