In the very first section where we discussed the Architecture of Docker, we talked about the "Dockerfile" which is used to build a "Docker Image".

A "Dockerfile" is a script-like text file that contains a series of instructions to build a "Docker image". Docker uses this file to create a deployable image of an application or service. The Dockerfile defines what goes into the image, including application code, environment variables, configuration files, dependencies, and commands to run the application.

# KEY DOCKERFILE INSTRUCTIONS

## 1. FROM

This will set the "base image" for a build. For example, "Alpine". Usually this is the very first instruction in a "Dockerfile" and it is essential, as it defines the starting point for the new image.

The base image is typically an operating system (like Ubuntu) or a pre-configured application environment (like Node.js, Python, or Java). Using a base image allows developers to avoid creating everything from scratch, as these images often come with essential packages and configurations for specific tasks.

The syntax is typically like this - 

    FROM <image>[:<tag>]

<image> is the name of the base image e.g. ubuntu, node, python.

<tag> is optional but it can be used to specify some specific version e.g. "node:14", "python:3.9" etc. If not specified, it will use the latest version by default.

For example - 

    FROM node:14

This example uses the Node.js version 14 image as the base. The Docker image created from this Dockerfile will have Node.js pre-installed, so you can start building a Node.js application without installing Node.js manually.

## 2. LABEL

If we want to add some "Metadata" to an image, then we can use the "LABEL" instruction. This helps provide additional information in a structured way and this metadata can be useful for organizaing, searching, or identifying the information about the image.

The syntax is like this - 

    LABEL <key> = <value> <key> = <value> ...

Here, <key> is the name of the label, e.g. "maintainer", "version", "description" etc. 

<value> is the information you want to assign to that label.

For example -

    FROM node:14
    LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"
    LABEL version="1.0"
    LABEL description="This is a Docker image for a sample Node.js application"

When we run "docker inspect image_name", then whatever this command outputs is what was added using "LABEL" to that image's Dockerfile.

## 3. RUN

The "RUN" instruction in a Dockerfile is used to execute commands in a new layer on top of the current image, then commit the results. Each RUN command generates a new image layer and is often used to install software packages, configure the environment, or set up the application.

The syntax is like this - 

    RUN <command>

There are two ways in which we can specify commands with "RUN" - 

1. Shell Form: Executes the commands in a shell. For example -

    RUN apt-get updae && apt-get install -y nginx

2. Exec Form: Runs directly without a shell. Useful for avoiding the shell parsing and running commands with arguments. For example -
    RUN ["apt-get", "install", "-y", "nginx"]

For example, let's say we want to specify in the Dockerfile that we want to update the package list and install Node.js and npm. So, we will write -

    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y nodejs npm

Note that using "&&" to chain commands in a single "RUN" instruction reduces the number of layers and makes the image smaller.

## 4. WORKDIR

The "WORKDIR" instruction in a Dockerfile sets the working directory for any subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile (like COPY, RUN, and CMD). This means that, after specifying a WORKDIR, any relative paths in following instructions will be based on this directory.

The syntax is like this -

    WORKDIR <directory>

Here, <directory> is the path where you want to set the working directory. If the specified directory doesn’t already exist, Docker will create it.

For example -

    WORKDIR /app

This will set "/app" as the current working directory. Now, when we write the "RUN" instruction as well, the working directory will be "/app" only. It means, if we write -
    
    RUN npm install

Now, the "npm install" will install the dependencies in the "/app" directory.

## 5. COPY

The "COPY" instruction in a Dockerfile is used to copy files and directories from your local filesystem into the Docker image. This allows you to include application code, configuration files, or other resources directly in the image.

The syntax is like this -

    COPY <source> <destination>

Here, <source> is the path of the file or directory on your local machine. You can specify both relative paths or absolute paths.

<destination> is the path within the Docker image where the files or directories will be copied. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

For example - 

    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package*.json ./

This will copy the "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files to the "/app" directory in the container.

If we want to copy all the files from current directory to the Docker Container, then we can write -

    COPY ..

## 6. ADD

The "ADD" instruction in a Dockerfile is used to copy files and directories from the host filesystem into the Docker image.

Sounds similar to "COPY" instruction, right?

Well, the "ADD" instruction offers additional functionality beyond simple copying which can be useful in some scenarios.

The Syntax is like this -

    ADD <source> <destination>

So, what additional functionalities it offers?

1. File Extraction - The "ADD" instruction can automatically extract local tar files e.g. .tar, .tar.gz, .zip etc. when copied to the image. The "COPY" instruction does not extract files, it just copes them as-is. For example -

    ADD myapp.tar.gz /app

This "ADD" command will copy and extract "myapp.tar.gz" into the "/app" directory in the container.

2. Remote URLs - The "ADD" instruction supports fetching files from the remote URLs and adding them to the image. This support is not present for "COPY" instruction which only copies files from the local filesystem to the container. For example -

    ADD https://example.com/file.zip /app/file.zip

Use "COPY" when you only need to copy files from your local machine into the container. It’s simpler, more predictable, and considered best practice when additional features aren’t needed.

Use "ADD" when you need tar extraction or downloading from URLs. However, this functionality can sometimes be unclear, so it’s generally better to use "COPY" for regular file copies and use "RUN curl" or "RUN wget" for downloading files from the internet if needed.

## 7. CMD

The "CMD" instruction in a Dockerfile specifies the default command that will run when a container starts. This command is intended to launch the main process of the container. Unlike the RUN instruction, which executes commands at build time, CMD runs when the container is started, not during the image creation.

There are three forms of "CMD" instructions, each with a different purpose and behavior.

1. Exec Form (recommended): This runs without a shell, which avoids shell-related issues. For example - 

    CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

2. Shell Form: Runs the command within a shell, usually "/bin/sh -c" on Linux. For example -

    CMD executable param1 param2

3. Default Parameter Form: Provides default parameters to an "ENTRYPOINT" instruction -

    CMD ["param1", "param2"]

For example, if we write -

    CMD ["node", "app.js"]

It specifies that "node app.js" should be executed when the container starts. This runs the Node.js application.

It is very important to note that a Dockerfile can have only one "CMD" instruction. Even if you specify multiple "CMD" instructions, then only the last one will be used.

Moreover, "CMD" can be overridden when you start a container. For example, if you run -

    docker run my-image echo "Hello World!"

Now, the container will run echo "Hello World!" and not the command specified in the "CMD" instruction.

## 8. ENTRYPOINT

The "ENTRYPOINT" instruction in a Dockerfile specifies the main executable that will always run when a container starts.

Sounds similar to "CMD", right?

Unlike "CMD", which provides default commands or arguments that can be overridden, "ENTRYPOINT" is intended to define the primary command that should be run every time the container starts, making it less flexible but often more predictable.

It also has multile forms - 

1. Exec Form (recommended) - Uses the executable and parameters as a JSON array. This avoids issues with shell parsing. For example - 

    ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

2. Shell Form - Runs the command within a shell. For example -

    ENTRYPOINT executable param1 param2

So, for example, if we write -

    ENTRYPOINT ["curl"]

This will set "curl" as the main executable command that will always run when the container starts. And if we want to provide a default URL for this "curl" command, we can use "CMD" -

    ENTRYPOINT ["curl"]
    CMD ["http://example.com"]

So, when you run this container, it will execute -

    curl http://example.com

Now, if you run the container with a different argument like this -

    docker run my-image http://another-url.com

This will override the "CMD" argumet but it will still use "curl" as the "ENTRYPOINT" executable.

So, that's the main difference between "CMD" and "ENTRYPOINT". "CMD" can be overridden completely whereas the "ENTRYPOINT" commands are not entirely overriden and hence, the "ENTRYPOINT" instruction is ideal for containers meant to run a specific application or process.

Often, "ENTRYPOINT" is used to specify the main executable, while "CMD" provides default arguments. This allows for a flexible setup where "ENTRYPOINT" enforces a command, and "CMD" offers parameters that can be changed.

For example - 

    ENTRYPOINT ["node"]
    CMD ["app.js"]

The ENTRYPOINT specifies node as the executable.

The CMD specifies app.js as the default argument.

Running this container will execute "node app.js", but running it with "docker run my-image another-script.js" will execute "node another-script.js".

## 9. EXPOSE

The "EXPOSE" instruction in a Dockerfile is used to specify which network ports the container will listen on at runtime. It essentially documents which ports the containerized application expects to be accessible, helping other developers or systems understand which ports should be open for communication with the container.

It is important to note that this is only for "documentation" purpose and this does not open the port itself. So, it does not do any network configuration.

For example, if we write -

    EXPOSE 3000

This indicates that the container’s application will listen on port "3000", typically used here for a Node.js server.

"EXPOSE" doesn’t actually make the port accessible outside of the container. To access the port on your local machine, you need to publish it with the -p or -P flag when running the container. For example -

    docker run -p 3000:3000 my-image

You can use "EXPOSE" to specify multiple ports -

    EXPOSE 3000 8080

So, when to use it?

It serves as a form of documentation within the Dockerfile, indicating which ports are necessary for communication.

It helps with automatic port mapping when containers are linked in Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

In summary, "EXPOSE" is primarily used to document which ports should be accessible, and for mapping, you still need to specify port publishing when starting the container with docker run -p.

# EXAMPLE DOCKERFILE

Let's see how a typical Dockerfile will look like which uses all the instructions we discussed so far.

    # Set the base image
    FROM node:14

    # Set metadata labels for documentation and identification
    LABEL maintainer="developer@example.com"
    LABEL version="1.0"
    LABEL description="A simple Node.js web application Docker image"

    # Set the working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files and install dependencies
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    # Add the README file for documentation
    COPY README.md /app/README.md

    # Extract the config.tar.gz file into the /app/config directory
    ADD config.tar.gz /app/config

    # Copy the remaining application files to the container
    COPY ..

    # Expose port 3000 for application access
    EXPOSE 3000

    # Set entrypoint to run Node.js
    ENTRYPOINT ["node"]

    # Default command to run the application
    CMD ["app.js"]
