We all know about GitHub, right?

Well, Continer Registries are like GitHub, but for Docker images.

The Container Registry in Docker is a service that stores and distributes Docker images. It acts as a repository where Docker images can be pushed, pulled, and managed efficiently. 

There is a public registry by Docker named "Docker Hub" which is the default registry when "Docker" is installed. This has millions of pre-built imags that you can use for your application. Here is the official website for Docker Hub -> https://hub.docker.com/

In docker hub, the names are such that you will have the "username", the "repository name" and the "tag". For example - 

    arvind/catcontainer:latest

You can deploy your own "private Docker Registry" using the official Docker Registry image (registry). This is useful for enterprises or specific use cases requiring high control over image distribution.

There are many "Cloud" based registries as well such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Container Registry (GCR), Azure Container Registry (ACR) etc.
