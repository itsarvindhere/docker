What exactly are "Environment Variables"?

"Environment variables" in Docker are a way to pass configuration or settings into a container at runtime. They are commonly used to customize container behavior without modifying the container image.

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice.

Environment variables are made up of a name and a value, such as API_KEY=1234567890. They are usually named in uppercase, with words joined by an underscore. 

# HOW TO USE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN DOCKER

1. **PASSING VARIABLES AT RUNTIME**

We can use the "docker run" command to pass environment variables at runtime to the container. For that, we use the "-e" or "--env" flag to pass the variables directly.

This is the syntax -

    docker run -e VAR_NAME=value my-image

Here, "VAR_NAME" is the name of the environment variable and "value" is its value.

For example -

    docker run -e APP_ENV=production -e APP_DEBUG=false my-app

Here, we are passing two environment variables -

    APP_ENV=production
    APP_DEBUG=false

2. **USING AN ENVIRONMENT FILE**

If we have a lot of variables or maybe different values for different environments, it is a good idea to have a file with all the environment variables so that we just give that file whenever we run a container.

We can do that by creating a new text file. For example, it can have the following - 

    APP_ENV=production
    APP_DEBUG=false
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:pass@localhost/db

And now, we can write this command to pass these environment variables to the container -

    docker run --env-file <filepath> my-app

3. **SETTING VARIABLES IN A DOCKERFILE**

We can also set environment variables in a dockerfile of an image. So, for that, we can use "ENV" insturction -

    ENV APP_ENV production
    ENV APP_DEBUG false

These variables will be baked into the image and available when the container starts.

# EXAMPLE USING AN ACTUAL DOCKER IMAGE

Let's take an example. Suppose, we want to run "phpmyadmin" image and we want to set the environment variable "PMA_ARBITRARY" to "1". We can write -

    docker run --name phpmyadmin -d -p 8081:80 -e PMA_ARBITRARY=1 phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin

When we write "PMA_ARBITRARY=1", it lets us specify the server to use each time via the UI, vs statically setting this.

When this command runs, it will run a new container on "localhost:8081" with "phpmyadmin".

"phpMyAdmin" is a free, open-source tool that allows users to administer MySQL or MariaDB databases using a web browser.

We will create a new database container using only environment variables. Let's create a "MariaDB" container. First, let's pull down the mariaDB image -

    docker pull mariadb:10.6.4-focal

This command will download this specific version of "MariaDB" image. When this command is complete, we will have a local copy of "MariaDB" image.

If we inspect this local image that we got using -

    docker inspect <image_id>

You will find one "Env" section in the JSON response. Something like this -

    "Env": [
        "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
        "GOSU_VERSION=1.13",
        "MARIADB_MAJOR=10.6",
        "MARIADB_VERSION=1:10.6.4+maria~focal"
    ],

These are all environment variables. So, when we run a new container from this image, there will be an environment variable named "PATH". This defines the folders where the system will look for executatable files. So, when you run a command in the container, the system searches these directories in order to find the command's executable.

Now, we will run a new container from this image and we will specify some environment variables which are necessary to configure "mariaDB" database engine -

    docker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somewordpress -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress -e MYSQL_USER=wordpress -d mariadb:10.6.4-focal --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

Looks confusing? Let's break it down.

So, we are running a new container from the image "mariadb:10.6.4-focal" and this container is named "db". We are running this container in detached mode, hence the "-d" flag. Then, we have some environment variables specified. These are -

    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somewordpress
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress
    MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress
    MYSQL_USER=wordpress

"MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" sets the mariaDB root password

"MYSQL_DATABASE" creates a database with the name of the env variable value wordpress in this example

"MYSQL_USER" creates a mariaDB user

"MYSQL_PASSWORD" creates a password for that user

Finally, we have this line -

    --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

This is used to set the default authentication plugin for new users created in the database. Specifically, it sets the "mysql_native_password" plugin as the default authentication method.

When we run the above command, a new container will start. Let's inspect it -

    docker inspect container_id

We will see a "Netoworks" key in the response and inside that, we have "IPAddress". Note that this one because we are going to use it when we login using "phpMyAdmin". In my case it is - 

    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3"

Remember that phpMyAdmin container we launched earlier? Well, time to use it.

That container is mapped to port "8081" on our host so we can go to "localhost:8081" and we will see the login page. Here, enter the server as the IP Address that you copied before.

And the username will be "root" and the password will be "somewordpress" because that's the root password we set using the environment variables.

And if everything goes fine, you will be in the dashboard.

![alt text](image-7.png)

If you go to the "User Accounts" tab you should see the new "wordpress" user that we added using the Environment variables too.

Now, let's run a bash shell in the container using "docker exec" -

    docker exec -it db bash

Now, we can run commands that will run in the terminal inside the container. 

![alt text](image-8.png)

If you run "df -k" to see all the drives, you will see that there are no external mapped drives or mounts in this container. All the storage that this container uses is within the container. So, if the container is deleted, the data will be removed too.

The files for mariaDB database are stored in this location - "/var/lib/mysql". And you can see them using this command -

    cd /var/lib/mysql

So first, we go to that folder. And now, we run -

    ls -la

![alt text](image-9.png)

So, if we delete this container, all the data within this container will also be lost. We will see in he next section how to fix this problem.
